## SOFTWARE TESTER AT WPG.SRL
*OCTOBER 2018 â€“ PRESENT*

### Responsibilities

#### Manual Testing:
- **Team Collaboration:** Actively collaborated with international team members from Paraguay, the Netherlands, and Portugal, fostering a dynamic and diverse testing environment.
- **Issue Management:** Utilized Jira to replicate customer issue tickets in a local test environment, meticulously documenting the reproduction process. This included capturing screenshots, logging error logs, and detailing steps to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
- **Efficiency Improvements:** Enhanced troubleshooting efficiency by developing comprehensive test reports and streamlining communication between developers and QA teams, which led to quicker resolution times and improved product quality.

#### Automation of Testing Tasks:
- **Test Automation Development:** Developed and implemented automated testing scripts using Selenium and Python, aiming to replace manual testing methods for routine test cases which led to a 40% reduction in manual testing hours.
- **Integration and Collaboration:** Worked closely with software developers and product managers to integrate automated tests into the continuous integration pipeline. This collaboration improved the detection of bugs early in the development cycle, significantly reducing the cost and time spent on later-stage fixes.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly reviewed and updated test scripts to adapt to new system features and changes, maintaining high relevance and coverage of automated tests.

#### Python Software Development:
- **XML Testing Framework:** Designed and developed an XML message testing framework using Python, which allowed for automated validation of XML messages against predefined schemas. This framework significantly improved the accuracy and speed of backend testing.
- **Tool Development:** Implemented a versatile tool that converts XSD (XML Schema Definition) files into XML-structured Excel files. This tool greatly facilitated test case management by allowing testers and developers to quickly configure and generate test data based on schema changes.
- **Impact on Test Management:** The tools and frameworks I developed have been critical in reducing setup times for testing environments and have enabled more rigorous, structured, and repeatable testing processes.
