## Software Tester at WPG.SRL
*October 2018 – JANUARY 2024*

### The Testing Landscape

My tenure at WPG.SRL has been marked by a commitment to improving the quality and efficiency of software testing. Here's a snapshot of my journey and the strides we've made in elevating the testing processes.

### Core Responsibilities

#### Manual Testing Efforts
- **Collaborative Testing**: I've had the opportunity to work alongside a talented, multicultural team from Paraguay, the Netherlands, and Portugal, creating a rich collaborative environment.
- **Issue Management**: Using Jira, I replicated and documented customer issues, providing detailed reports to ensure effective communication and problem-solving with the development team.
- **Process Optimization**: By refining test reports and communication flows, we've managed to accelerate the troubleshooting process, directly enhancing product quality and team efficiency.

#### Transition to Automation
- **Crafting Automated Scripts**: Embracing the power of Selenium and Python, I've contributed to developing automated tests that have reduced manual testing efforts by 40%.
- **CI Pipeline Integration**: Close coordination with developers and product managers has allowed the seamless integration of automated tests into the continuous delivery workflow, helping to catch bugs early and save valuable resources.
- **Evolving with the Product**: Constant updates to the automation scripts ensure they keep pace with our ever-evolving software features, maintaining comprehensive test coverage.

#### Python and Testing Synergy
- **XML Testing Framework**: I spearheaded the creation of a Python-based framework to automate XML message validation, enhancing the precision and velocity of backend testing.
- **Innovative Tool Development**: Another milestone was developing a tool that transforms XSD files into user-friendly Excel formats, streamlining test data generation and management.
- **Revamping Test Management**: The tools I've designed play a pivotal role in reducing the setup times for test environments, leading to more efficient and replicable testing protocols.

### Reflections on the Role

In reflecting on my role, the key takeaway has been the importance of adaptability and continuous learning. Whether it’s through enhancing manual testing practices or embracing automation and development, the goal has always been to ensure that we can deliver a product that stands up to the rigorous demands of our users.

### Looking Ahead

As technology continues to advance, I’m excited to further refine our testing methodologies and continue contributing to the delivery of software that is not only functional but also robust and user-centric.
