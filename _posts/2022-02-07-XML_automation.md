## Automated Ad Posting

In the realm of my 3D printing business, managing online ads across multiple marketplaces became a time-consuming and error-prone task. That's where the concept of automated ad posting came into playâ€”streamlining the process and eliminating manual errors.

### The Challenge

Manually posting ads for each product on different platforms like Clasipar, Hendyla, and Instagram, not to mention attempting to break into Facebook's marketplace, was a daunting daily routine that required a significant amount of time and attention to detail.

### The Solution

The development of an automated system using Python and Selenium became the optimal solution. This system is designed to:

- Read product data from an organized Excel file.
- Transform the data into structured ad objects.
- Automate the posting process on various marketplace platforms using Selenium.

### How It Works

Here's a step-by-step guide on how the automated posting system operates:

1. **Credentials Setup**: First, set up your credentials for the marketplace platforms within the Excel file.
   

2. **Product Entry**: Next, add your product details in the products tab of the Excel file.
   

3. **Execution**: Run the `auto_poster.py` script to initiate the automated posting process.
   

4. **Observe**: Watch as the script autonomously navigates each platform and posts your ads.


As a result, I was able to post multiple pages of ads for my business, saving time and improving accuracy.

### Demo and Resources

I've created a demonstration video (in Spanish) showcasing the automated ad posting in action. Note that it's not a professional-grade video, but it effectively illustrates the program's capabilities.

To set up and use the automated posting system for your own business, here are the steps to get started:

- **Chrome Driver**: Ensure you have the latest Chrome browser installed from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
- **Project Files**: Download the project from my GitHub: [Automated Posting on GitHub](https://github.com/IvanWeissVanDerPolGH/automated-posting).
- **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies for the project as listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

The system has proven to be an invaluable asset to my business, streamlining the ad posting process across multiple platforms and allowing me to focus on other critical aspects of my business.
