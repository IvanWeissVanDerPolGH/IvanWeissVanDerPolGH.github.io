### Introduction to the Flyte Project

At MentorMate, I've been involved in a transformative project known as Flyte. This project is at the intersection of technology and healthcare, providing a novel solution to a common but often overlooked problem—pelvic floor health.

### Purpose

The essence of Flyte lies in its dual-component system: a state-of-the-art mobile application paired with the Flyte wand—an FDA-cleared therapeutic device designed to combat stress urinary incontinence and bolster pelvic floor muscles. The system is made complete with the Provider Portal, a tool that empowers healthcare providers to track and support their patients' rehabilitation journey.

### Business Impact

Flyte’s technology suite represents a significant leap forward in home-based health management, offering a discreet, non-invasive treatment option backed by professional guidance. It's a product that promises not just better health outcomes, but also improved quality of life for its users.

### Project Features

#### For the Users: The Mobile Application

- **Guided Therapy:** Interactive sessions with the Flyte wand, complemented by exercises for strengthening the pelvic floor.
- **Progress Insights:** Users can monitor their progress through a 6-week program, with detailed reports on therapy outcomes.
- **Health Surveys:** In-app ICIQ surveys help users to assess improvements in their condition over time.
- **Personal Health Goals:** A goal-setting feature allows users to personalize their health objectives and monitor advances using a slider interface.
- **Resource Center:** A wealth of educational content is available to users, ensuring they are well-informed about their health and device usage.
- **Customer Support:** Users have immediate access to Flyte’s customer care for any inquiries or additional guidance.

#### For Healthcare Professionals: The Provider Portal

- **Patient Data Access:** Real-time access to patient therapy sessions, survey outcomes, and progress notes.
- **Notes and Records:** Providers can maintain comprehensive records with the ability to annotate and manage notes.
- **Management Console:** A dedicated platform for clinicians to oversee patient profiles and treatment plans.
- **Communication Facilities:** Built-in tools facilitate direct communication regarding treatment plans and progress.

### Technical Backbone

- **Integration:** The mobile app and Provider Portal are integrated to ensure synchronicity of patient data.
- **Security:** Advanced security protocols, including SSL pinning, protect the integrity of data exchanges.
- **User-Centric Design:** A focus on accessibility and engagement, with adaptive design for a range of devices.

### Continuous Evolution

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, and SQL were at the core of the backend automation, frontend interactions, and database management.
- **Professional Tools:** Regular use of Postman for API validation, Charles Proxy for network management, and MongoDB for database operations.
- **Development Frameworks:** The project leveraged React for the frontend and Django for backend processes, with Pandas for data analysis.

### Personal Takeaways

- **Collaborative Dynamics:** I had the pleasure of working with a diverse team spanning Paraguay and Bulgaria, which enriched the project with a wide array of cultural insights and professional expertise.
- **Growth and Mentorship:** I greatly benefited from the mentorship provided by an experienced QE lead, which was instrumental in my professional development.
- **My Contributions:** My role included developing automation scripts for data management in MongoDB and performing endpoint testing with Postman, enhancing the robustness of our applications.
